= Repeat Order option =
With our extension you can integrate and display the button “re-order”, “repeat order” on the overview page. 

This allows your customer to place the same order easily without going through your site to find the same product again, which they purchased in the past.

&#9989; If an ordered product no longer exists it gives the name of the product that can't be added to the cart (remaining products will be added)
&#9989; If the product variation has changed then it gives a message that **they need to add that product manually**
&#9989; Options to customize the text of the button and message shown
